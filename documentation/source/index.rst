==========================
Open62541 Server Template
==========================

This library is part of the SWAP-IT software modules and builds on the open62541 open source OPC UA SDK (https://www.open62541.org/). This software module provides a set of utility functions that can
transform any open62541 based OPC UA server application into a SWAP-IT application. Consequently, the server application will be extendet with an additional set ob OPC UA Objects, Variables
and Methods to interact with ofther SWAP-IT software modules. The software requires a custom information model which extends the Common Information Model, as well as a JSON configuration to
customize the added information model.
